# Cookies
## What's a cookie?
An HTTP cookie is a [small piece of data](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4100324/how-many-characters-can-be-stored-in-4kb) sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser. Every time the user loads the website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server in the HTTP Request Header. Cookies are commonly used to track whether a user is logged in or not. They can also be used to record user preferences.

Our goal today is to harness the power of cookies. First, to track users to our website. And secondly, to track their login "session".

## Reading and Writing Cookies -- Server Side

**Writing Cookies**:

```javascript

var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/", function (req, res) {

  // write the HTTP Cookie to the Response Header
  res.set({
    "Set-Cookie": "message=hello"
  });
  
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("UP AND RUNNING");
});

```

**Reading Cookies** (from inside any route):

``` javascript
// read the HTTP Cookie from Request Header
var cookieStr = req.get("Cookie"); 
```

#### Using `cookie-parser`
In practice we'll use `cookie-parser` middleware to so that we don't have to deal with string manipulation, and can just manipulate an object of key-value pairs. (We did the same thing with `body-parser` middleware).

First we have to install `cookie-parser`:

```bash
npm install --save cookie-parser
```
And now we just tell our app to use `cookie-parser`.

```javascript
var express      = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

```

Altogether that looks like:

```javascript

var express      = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.cookie.message); // "hello"
  res.cookie("message", "hello again"); // overwrite
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("UP AND RUNNING");
});
```

**HTTP Response Header**

This sends a response that looks something like the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Set-Cookie: message=hello%20again
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
ETag: W/"b-4a17b156"
Date: Mon, 18 May 2015 07:36:50 GMT
Connection: keep-alive

Hello World
```

The Cookie is then saved to the browser for localhost:3000. You can view it in the Chrome Developer Console under the "resources" tab. [Try this](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/iterate/manage-data/cookies?hl=en).

Once the cookie is set in the browser, any subsequent request to the website automatically has the following line in the HTTP Request Header:

```
...
  cookie: 'message=hello',
...
```

## Reading and Writing Cookies -- Client Side
It's also possible to manipulate cookies on the client-side.

From the Chrome Developer Console:

``` javascript
document.cookie; // "message=hello"
```

You can write to this string simply by reassigning its value. Take care though that you don't overwrite anything important (and watch out for spaces and semi-colons)!

``` javascript
document.cookie += "; magic_number=10;"
document.cookie; // "message=hello; magic_humber=10;"
```

Try it out! Open your Console, and see what cookies are set in your browser. Try it out on a few different websites.

* Can you create a new cookie.
* Can you overwrite an existing cookie.
* Can you add a key-value pair to an existing cookie.
* Can you log yourself out of a website by deleting your cookie (and refreshing the page)?

For more on this approach, take a look at [Quirksmode on Cookies](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html).

# Sessions
Cookies are great, but they're limited in size, and they're hard to work with. If we want finer control, we want sessions!

Imagine for a moment that we have a fancy quiz-app and we used cookies to store user preferences and the current state of the quiz. Eventually the request header might look like:

```
host: quizful.ly
method: GET
cookie: wrong_answers=7; right_answer=3; current_question=11; GeoIP=US:CA:San_Francisco:37.7909:-122.4017:v4; last_access=31-Aug-2015;
```

Now imagine that, instead of storing all this data in the browser, the server kept it in a database. And everytime someone visits the website for the first time, they're assigned a *globally unique id*, or **guid**.

```
host: quizful.ly
method: GET
cookie: guid=a134vbce34584ibjeapc38;
```

Now, instead of needing to read, parse, and manipulate all the data in the cookie, we can just find the user's session based on their **guid**.

Here's the cheater way of doing this (the real way is using `express-session` middleware):

``` javascript

var sessions = {};

// stubbed data
sessions["a134vbce34584ibjeapc38"] = {
    wrong_answers: 7,
    right_answers: 3,
    current_question: 11,
    GeoIp: "US:CA:San_Francisco:37.7909:-122.4017:v4",
    last_access: "31-Aug-2015"
}


app.get("/quiz", function(){
    // sets the guid if none exists
    res.set("guid", randomly_generated_unique_identifer)
    // adds a new object to the sessions object, above
    //...
})

app.post("/answer", function(){
    var guid = res.cookies.guid;
    var session = sessions[guid];
    
    var answer = res.query.answer;
    if ( right_answer ) {
        // update session
        session.right_answers +=1;
        session.current_question +=1;
        res.send({verdict: "correct"})
    } else {
        // update session
        session.wrong_answers +=1;
        res.send({verdict: "incorrect"})
    }
})

```

Later we'll learn about `express-sessions` middleware.
